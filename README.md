# Data Structures and Patterns
Most problems fit into many patterns and subpatterns, so there is no perfect fit for each problem. The general rule of thumb I follow is: if the problem fits a specifit pattern, it goes into that pattern's folder. If there are many patterns for a problem (two pointer + sliding window), it will fall into the folder for the pattern that the approach focuses on. Ad hoc problems that don't follow a particular popular pattern fall into their respective data structure folders.
# **Tree**

## Representations
###### Binary Search Tree
- Has binary search tree property
- Inorder traversal visits nodes in increasing order
###### Height-Balanced
- Tree height is log(N)
- DFS traversals are O(log(N))

## Traversals
- Preorder (Root -> Left -> Right)
- Inorder (Left -> Root -> Right)
- Postorder (Left -> Right -> Root)
- Reverse Preorder (Root -> Left -> Right
- Reverse Inorder (Right -> Root -> Left
- Reverse Postorder (Root -> Right -> Left
- BFS
