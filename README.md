# Data Structures and Algorithms / Patterns and Subpatterns
Most solutions fit into multiple patterns and subpatterns, so there is no perfect fit for each one. The general rule of thumb I follow is: if the solution fits a specific pattern, it goes into that pattern's folder. If there are many patterns that make up a solution (two pointer + sliding window), it will generally fall into the folder for the pattern that the approach focuses on or has a bigger reach in terms of importance for the solution. Ad hoc solutions that don't follow a particular popular pattern fall into their respective data structure folders.
# **Tree**

## Overview
###### Representations
- Binary Search Tree
- Has binary search tree property
- Inorder traversal visits nodes in increasing order
###### Properties
- Height-balanced vs not height-balanced
- Tree height is log(N)
- DFS traversals are O(log(N))

###### Traversals
- Preorder (Root -> Left -> Right)
- Inorder (Left -> Root -> Right)
- Postorder (Left -> Right -> Root)
- Reverse Preorder (Root -> Left -> Right
- Reverse Inorder (Right -> Root -> Left
- Reverse Postorder (Root -> Right -> Left
- BFS
