# Data Structures and Patterns
Most problems fit in many patterns and subpatterns, so there is no perfect fit for each problem. The general rule of thumb I follow is: if the problem fits a specifit pattern, it goes into that pattern's folder. If there are many patterns for a problem (two pointer + sliding window), it will fall into the folder for the pattern that the approach focuses on. Ad hoc problems that don't follow a particular popular pattern fall into their respective data structure folders.
